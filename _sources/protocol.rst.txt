******************************
EventMQ Protocol Specification
******************************
*The status of this document is alpha and subject to heavy change*

Goals
=====
The EventMQ Protocol (eMQP) defines a reliable service-oriented request-reply and pub-sub dialog between a set of clients, a broker, and a set of workers.

The goals are to:

 * Specify a protocol to follow when implementing a component to EventMQ.
 * Allow requests to be routed to workers by an abstracted service name (named queues).
 * Detect disconnected peers through heartbeating.
 * Allow for message tracing and debugging.

Architecture
============
insert pretty picture here

Topology
--------
eMQP connects a set of client applications (e.g. web servers), a broker, and a pool of workers. Clients connect to the broker as well as the workers.

'Clients' is defined as application issuing requests and 'workers' as applications that process these requests. (Workers consist of a `JobManager` and a pool of `Worker` resources where the job executes.)

The EventMQ broker handles a set of named queues. The broker SHOULD serve clients on a fair request and MAY deliver requests to workers on any basis, including 0MQ's built-in round robin or least-recently used.

ROUTER Addressing
-----------------
In the case of request-reply, the broker MUST use a ROUTER socket to accept requests from both clients and workers. The broker MAY use a seperate socket implementing a subset of eMQP, or MAY use a single socket implementing all of eMQP.

From the 0MQ manual[[2](http://api.zeromq.org/master:zmq-socket)]
> When receiving messages a ROUTER socket shall prepend a message part containing the identity of the originating peer to the message before passing it to the application. When sending messages a ROUTER socket shall remove the first part of the message and use it to determine the identity of the peer the message shall be routed to.

This extra frame is not shown in the specifications below.

Heartbeating
------------
 * HEARTBEAT commands are valid at any time after an INFORM command.
 * Any command except DISCONNECT act as a heartbeat. Peers SHOULD NOT send HEARTBEAT commands while sending other commands.
 * Worker and broker MUST send heartbeats at regular and agreed-upon intervals.
 * Scheduler and broker MUST send heartbeats at regular and agreed-upon intervals.
 * If the worker detects that the broker disconnected it SHOULD restart the conversation.
 * If the broker detects that a worker has disconnected it should stop sending it a message of any type.
 * If the scheduler detects that the broker disconnects it SHOULD restart the conversation.

Headers
---------------
Headers MUST be 0 to many comma seperated values inserted into the header field. If there are no headers required, an empty string MUST be sent where headers are required.

Below is a table which defines and describes the headers.


================= ======= ======= ======== ======= ===========
Header            REQUEST PUBLISH SCHEDULE Default Description
================= ======= ======= ======== ======= ===========
reply-requested   X                        False   Once the job is finished, send a reply back with information from the job. If there is no information reply with a True value.
retry-count:#     X                        0       Retry a failed job this many times before accepting defeat.
timeout:#         X                        0       Kill the job after X seconds, defaults to never timing out (0)
guarantee         X                        False   Ensure the job completes by letting someone else worry about a success reply.
nohaste                           X        False   When scheduling a job, set this to True if you don't want the job to run immediately as it's scheduled.  Instead, it will run for the first time when the interval has elapsed.
================= ======= ======= ======== ======= ===========

DISCONNECT and KBAI
===================
When a component receives a DISCONNECT command it:
 * MUST send a KBAI command to all connected components.
 * MUST stop sending and receiving any messages
 * MUST allow any pending messages or jobs to complete.

When a component receives a KBAI command it:
 * MUST stop sending any messages to the disconnecting component.
 * SHOULD Clean up references to the disconnecting component.
